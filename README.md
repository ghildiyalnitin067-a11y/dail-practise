\## Day 3 – JavaScript Basics



Today I studied JavaScript fundamentals including variables,

conditional statements, and looping constructs such as for

loops and while loops. This helped me understand basic program

flow and logic building in JavaScript.





\## Day 4 – Combined JavaScript Basics



Today I practiced core JavaScript concepts including functions,

asynchronous execution using setTimeout, arrays and their

methods, string operations, and objects with property access.

This helped me understand how multiple JS concepts work

together in a single program.
